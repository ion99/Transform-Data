# Transform-Data

Write a function that transforms the start data structure into the expected data structure. Your function should not modify the original data structure -- instead, it should return a new structure.

Your solution will be judged using the following criteria:

correctness
efficiency
code quality
code size
copypasta (we only want to see YOUR code!)
We recommend spending 30 minutes on this problem.

Bonus: Use only methods from Object and Array instead of for or while loops. Array.forEach is not allowed.
